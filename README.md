# Ungrokker
Ungrokker is a browser extension that simply hides
any tweets that have @grok in them. Use with caution
as this extension requires developer mode turned on.

## Installation
turn developer mode on in your browser or use whatever
script monkey extension you want, then proceed to load extension
from where you downloaded the source code.
